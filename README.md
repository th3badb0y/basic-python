# basic-python

This is a Basic Python tutorial I made for a session for my juniors at college. I thought this might be helpful for others too. Feel free to clone, edit and share this.

Would appreciate edits and corrections.


### Jupyter Notebooks


The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

Jupyter provides a rich architecture for interactive data science and scientific computing with:
- Over 40 programming languages such as Python, R, Julia and Scala.
- A browser-based notebook with support for code, rich text, math expressions, plots and other rich media.
- Support for interactive data visualization.
- Easy to use tools for parallel computing.


[install jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to run these notebooks.

I have taken these tutorials and edited it depending on where I take my sessions.
